Task 02 : Stopwatch web Application

Excited to Share My Latest Project at Prodigy InfoTech
I've recently completed a task to design and implement a Responsive Stopwatch with intuitive controls. 
This project involved:

• Creating an interactive and user-friendly stopwatch web application.

• Implementing functions for starting, pausing, and resetting the stopwatch, as well as tracking and displaying lap times. 

• Utilizing HTML for structuring, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for adding dynamic behaviour.
