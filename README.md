Task 03: Tic-Tac-Toe Web application

Excited to share my latest project at Prodigy InfoTech
I'm excited to announce that I have successfully completed Task-03, building a Tic-Tac-Toe web application for Prodigy InfoTech!
This project allowed me to utilize my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive and engaging game. 
The application includes : 

• Features to handle user clicks, track game state, and check for winning conditions.

• Users can enjoy playing against each other, aiming to get three markers in a row to win.

• Utilizing HTML for structuring, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for adding dynamic behaviour.

This task was a fantastic opportunity to deepen my skills in front-end development and create a user-friendly interface that enhances the overall user experience.
